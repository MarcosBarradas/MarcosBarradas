How to Activate Windows / Office / Extended Security Updates (ESU)?
Method 1 - PowerShell ❤️
Click the Start Menu, type PowerShell, and open it.

Copy and paste the code below and press Enter.

For Windows 8.1, 10 and 11:
irm https://get.activated.win | iex
If the above is blocked (by ISP/DNS), try this (needs updated Windows 10 or 11):
iex (curl.exe -s --doh-url https://1.1.1.1/dns-query https://get.activated.win | Out-String)
Script not launching? Use the below-listed Method 2.
In the menu that appears, type the number corresponding to one of the Green options.

Method 2 - Traditional (Windows Vista and later)
Download the script:
MAS_AIO.cmd (Direct script)
MAS_AIO.zip (If the direct script is blocked by your browser)
Run the MAS_AIO.cmd file.
In the menu that appears, type the number corresponding to one of the Green options.
Tip

Some ISPs/DNS providers block access to our domains. You can bypass this by enabling DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) in your browser.

Note

The irm command in PowerShell downloads a script from a specified URL, and the iex command executes it.
Always double-check the URL before executing the command and verify the source is trustworthy when manually downloading files.
Be cautious of third parties spreading malware disguised as MAS by altering the URL in the PowerShell command.
